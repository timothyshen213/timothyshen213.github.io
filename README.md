I'm a Statistics Student at UC Davis. Here is my [CV](https://github.com/timothyshen213/timothyshen.github.io/blob/main/Timothy_Shen_CV_3_8.pdf "CV") and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothy-shen-3a7800221/ "linkedin")

## Research Project

### Modified Analytical Software for the OMF Data Center

[Radiant](https://radiant-rstats.github.io/docs/) is an open-source browser-based interface for business analytics. In order to cater towards biologists, I modified the existing Radiant packages through **R** and **R Shiny**. The following were the added features.

- **Save Function for CKAN**: Sends radiant state file to a targeted CKAN Server (igenomed.stanford.edu), allowing users to share their current progress and collaborate in Radiant. (https://github.com/timothyshen213/radiant.data)
- **Diganostic Function for Linear Regression**: Linear regression now offers the ability to run diagnostics tests to verify the validity of the assumptions. (https://github.com/timothyshen213/radiant.model)
- **Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) Feature**: Data can now be fitted to an ANOVA Model. Feature offers the ability to customize between one-way and two-way models. (https://github.com/timothyshen213/radiant.model)
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Feature**: Numerical variables can now be ran through a PCA Analysis. Features also offers the ability to visualize the analysis through biplot and screeplot. (https://github.com/timothyshen213/radiant.multivariate)

 **Project Summary**
 
 The project examined two approaches, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine, to classify early student dropouts in higher education. 
 
 - **Logistic Regression**: Built Gradient Descent based and Newton's Method based (through different matrix decomposition method) algorithms. Concluded Gradient Descent to have higher accuracy and computational efficiency.
 
 - **Support Vector Machines**: Explored different Kernel Methods and concluded the Linear Kernel produced the most optimal results.
 
 **Random Foresting** was also examined, along with explatory data analysis via **FAMD**.

### Housing Price Analysis  (December 2022)

Analysis of significant neighborhood characteristics to housing prices in metro areas (Dallas, Chicago, DC, LA).

 **Project Summary**
 
Datasets where acquired by **web-scraping APIs** for housing data and geo-coding. We conducted exploratory data analysis (principal component analysis) and **linear regression analysis**. It was concluded that each metro areas showed unique relationships between housing prices and the neighboring characterstics.

### Likelihood of Success for Disney+ Shows (June 2022)

A report on identifying the factors that lead to a successful Disney+ Show. Analysis done in R using Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and k-NN.

 **Project Summary**
 
To identify possible factors that are significant to the success of a Disney+ show, we ran **Logistic Regression**, **Linear Regression**, and **k-NN** across 7000+ Dinsey+ show dataset. It was found that certification (ie PG-13) leads to an increase in both audience rating and popularity, while genre showed little significance.
